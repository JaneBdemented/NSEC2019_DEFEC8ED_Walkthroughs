## README

This repo contains the solutions to the Forensics from the Coronors Office challenges from NSEC2019.

## Premise

Due to a rise in implant related malware and neuro-network attacks, as well as the tendencies for implant damage in violent
deaths, the Ministry of Health and Science has created a new forensics office branched off the Coronerâ€™s office. This
office investigates the implant data from strange or unnatural deaths, in an attempt to determine the cause of death and
to aid in police investigations.

## Special Note

Extra Awesomeness points if you can name the theme of the flags in these callenges and where each of them is from!
